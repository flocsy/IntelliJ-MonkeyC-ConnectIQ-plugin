# IntelliJ Monkey C language and Garmin Connect IQ plugin

<!-- Plugin description -->
This plugin adds support for [Monkey C language](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/programmers-guide/monkey-c/) and [Garmin Connect IQ SDK](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/overview/) in IntelliJ IDEA.

Note that it isn't under super-active development, I'm only trying to get the most essential features working again with the latest IntelliJ version.

### Features:

* (WIP) Monkey C grammar validation
* Syntax highlighting
* (WIP) Completion suggestions
* (WIP) Find usages / Go to declaration
* (WIP) Find by class or symbol name
* (WIP) API documentation provider
* (WIP) Method parameters info
* (WIP) Integration with compiler
* (WIP) Integration with simulator runner
* (WIP) Run unit tests
* (WIP) New project generation
* (WIP) App Settings support
* (WIP) Linux support (needs wine installed)


WIP - work in progress, means that there is some support, but it contains 
bugs or is incomplete


### Planned features (in random order):

* Support creating publishable artifact
* Formatting
* Collapse/expand
* Resources Rez. support in code
* Refactoring
* Showing usage error on unresolved (in scope) references
* Support Android Studio
* SDK manager
